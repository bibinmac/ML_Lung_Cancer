Testing Predictive Analytics for Lung Cancer detection 

We have set of datasets that describes cancer or general attributes of human body. Furthermore, it alligns with the understanding of the convolutional neural network to set the model via tenserflow training for further processing of the cancer dataset and then we analyse the loss and gain entropy with the accuracy graph.
